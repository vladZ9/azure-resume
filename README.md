# azure-resume

My own Azure resume project

## First steps

- Frontend folder contains the website.
- main.js contains visitor counter code.

## Second steps

- Created Azure CosmosDB account
- Setup the Azure Function with Visual Code locally
- Setup CosmosDB bindings to retrieve and update the view counter data
- Tested locally to make sure the website can see the view counter data
